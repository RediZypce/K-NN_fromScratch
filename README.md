# K-NN_fromScratch

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It's a simple yet powerful algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the training data. This repository provides an implementation of an advanced k-NN classifier from scratch in Python. [Check it out!](K-NN_fromScratch.ipynb)
